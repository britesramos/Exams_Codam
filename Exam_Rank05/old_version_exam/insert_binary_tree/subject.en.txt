Allowed functions: malloc

Implement a function that inserts a new node with a given value into a binary search tree.
The function should return a pointer to the root node of the modified binary search tree.
The function should be declared as follows:

t_btree* insert_binary_tree(t_btree* root, int value);

you have to use the ft_btree.h file, which will ONLY contain:

typedef struct s_btree
{
	int value;
	struct s_btree *left;
	struct s_btree *right;
}	t_btree;

If the root node is NULL return the new node as root.
Duplicate values should be ignored.
Values bigger than the root should be insert in the right subtree.
Values smaller than the root should be insert in the left subtree.
Values will always be inserted at the END of a subtree.
