Write a program that takes a file as an argument.

This file represents a 2D grid of characters, with each character being either
'.' or 'X', representing water and land, respectively.
Each line in the file (including the last one) ends with a newline, and all 
lines are of equal lenght. The maximum size of grid is 1000 x 1000.

A "land" character ('X') is said to be connected to another "land" character
if they are adjacent horizontal or vertically (but not diagonally).

Your task is to write a program that reads this grid from the input file and
displays the size of the largest island on stdout followed by a '\n'.

If the file is empty, or there is an error (such as inconsistent line lenght
or invalid characters), your program should print "Map Error\n".
